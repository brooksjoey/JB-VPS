# JB-VPS Repository Reorganization Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Strengths
- ✅ Plugin-based architecture (`bin/jb`, `lib/base.sh`, `plugins/`)
- ✅ Modular command system with registration
- ✅ Cross-platform package management
- ✅ Basic VPS initialization scripts
- ✅ Red Team automation framework
- ✅ Encrypted environment management

### Issues Identified
- ❌ Duplicate files between root and `Projects for Implementation/`
- ❌ Red Team files scattered and not properly integrated
- ❌ Missing enterprise-grade error handling and logging
- ❌ No idempotent script design
- ❌ Limited menu system with technical jargon
- ❌ No comprehensive documentation structure
- ❌ Missing backup and recovery mechanisms
